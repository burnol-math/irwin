# NOTA BENE (May 1, 2025)

# This was done in April at some point in development of
# irwin_v4.sage to test relative efficiencies of using
# @parallel.  For some forgotten rasons, the test2(), test3(),
# test4() and test5() all call the @parallel function with some
# explicit list range, rather than simply a start, end, step
# data. This probably causes some unefficiency and anyhow
# irwin_v5.sage has improved on this later on.  But this is not
# backported here.

# Another very important point to make is that there is
# definitely an upstream bug somewhere which causes usage or
# @parallel decorated functions to have very counter-intuitive
# after effects -- **after** the calls are done... See issue #1.
# This may interfere with various benchmarking which was
# attempted with this test file.

# Finally the procedure machin() does not emulate good enough
# the real life things done by irwin_v4 and later.

# fn=bar2 or fn=bar100 and R tested up to 10,000,000
#
# But using machin for fn is closer to what matters for irwin
# and I did not measure then any significant differences.
# In particular the worry about trying to have the workload
# evenly distributed among workers as in test3() and test5()
# seems not too warranted, test4() is fine in practice
# and has simpler shorter coding.

#
# Update May 1st: I should have tested with a procedure much
# closer to the computation of the real beta()'s because this
# testing underestimated the disadvantage of having among the 8
# parallel jobs some taking significantly longer than others.
# It is also very time-consuming and irritating to test things
# due to upstream bug/feature #1 which afflicts my system and
# makes my life lonely and miserable.  But the main problem here
# is that I did not test the real thing and for example I am
# using (this is bad) explicit lists rather than generators,
# contrarily to irwin_v5 code (which this predated anyhow).
